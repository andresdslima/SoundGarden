>**Technologies:** *HTML | CSS | Bootstrap | JavaScript*

During 4 intensive days of pair programming (me, @Lucas Veiga and @Anderson Sousa) and more than 20 hours of team work, we developed the brand new Sound Garden website.

Using DOM manipulation, Promise objects and Async/Await functions through JavaScript programming, we linked all website pages to an external API (containing Events and Event Bookings separately). As a result, on the Administrative Panel page, users are capable of Creating, Editing and Deleting Events and Event Bookings in the database.

Regarding HTML, CSS and Bootstrap, we developed a Event Bookings page, so users could check how many bookings there are for an specific event. We also developed a Booking formulary (Modal/Popup), so users could book how many tickets they want for an specific event. Lastly, we developed an image carousel using Bootstrap on the Home page. All website pages are working on Smartphones, Tablets and Laptops.
